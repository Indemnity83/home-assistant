# Home Assistant Automations & Blueprints by Indemnity83

A collection of my Home Assistant blueprints, automation helpers, and configuration snippets that I've found useful and wanted to share with the community.

## üß† Blueprints

### [üî¶ Motion Nightlight](https://github.com/Indemnity83/home-assistant/blob/main/blueprints/motion_nightlight.yaml)

This blueprint turns on a light with a smooth transition when motion is detected **and** the ambient light is below a configurable lux threshold. Designed with the [ThirdReality Multifunction Night Light](https://amzn.to/42qSZyK) in mind.

### [‚ùÑÔ∏è Smart HVAC Control](https://github.com/Indemnity83/home-assistant/blob/main/blueprints/smart_hvac_control.yaml)

This blueprint intelligently manages your thermostat based on occupancy, door/window status, and solar power availability. If a door or window is left open, it turns off the HVAC. When power is abundant (e.g. from solar), it cools to a preset temperature. Otherwise, or if nobody is home, it switches to eco mode. Designed for homes with solar and smart climate control.
